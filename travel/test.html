    <h6> Always delayed, random cars gave AC. Leave doors open while delayed so no AC. Worst service, if this was a real train it would be out of service. Disney claims they don't rub the monorail, nice escape of responsibility. Really bad, Disney has dropped its service level to the bottom. </h6>

    <h6> I was a little disappointed in the trash that was around Magic Kingdom. Trash cans full to the brim and paper on the ground. We came in the 80's and if a piece of paper hit the ground someone was cleaning up the paper. Saw workers just pass over paper while holding a broom and dust pan. They were just going thru the motions. Many were bunched up and just talking. I always thought that Disney was a step above all other parks in every way. Had a great time with the grandchildren at the park and maybe I am being a little picky but when you come to Disney you expect more.</h6>

    <h6>My wife and I have in the past holiday season visited Epcot, "Christmas Processional Concert and Dinner". The last time was 4 years ago. We entered Epcot at about 12:00 noon, had dinner at the Coral Reef, the Christmas Concert, Fireworks, then stayed overnight, had breakfast and walked around Downtown Disney before heading back home to our Southern Florida Home. We are year around Florida residents.</h6>

    <h6>I feel like you should have respect when paying $11,000 for a family vacation. I don't think families should be separated, especially with young children. I honestly am shocked and appalled at how rude the employees are. Btw don't eat at the restaurant on Hollywood and Vine. It was a rush to get you in and out. We had people wait to get in sitting in our dining chairs. Mickey skipped us. Just very unhappy with this experience.</h6>

    <h6> Wow! This place was really amazing! I came during the food and wine festival and it was awesome. I loved walking around in little parts of each country and trying the food there. Mmmm... Delicious! I also loved the Soarin' ride and the Test Track ride! They were so amusing! This was my first time to Epcot, and I have to say it was a blast! There was barely anyone there and the weather was fair. I would totally recommend coming here!</h6>
