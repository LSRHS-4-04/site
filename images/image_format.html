      <h1><u>Three Main Image Formats On The Web</u></h1>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p> PNG: (Portable Network Graphics) Similar to GIF, but we are choosing the number of colors up to 256. Used almost exclusively for web images, never print images. For photographs, PNG is not as good as JPEG, because it creates a larger file.
<p> JPEG: (Joint Photographic Experts Group) Is a format for compressing image files. When you create an image or capture a photo and save the picture in a JPEG format, you will reduce the quality of the image in exchange for making its file size smaller. If you have a picture of someone or somthing then this woudl be the best option.
<p> GIF: (Graphics Interchange Format) Similar to PNG, but GIF is a series of images put together to make a short, soundless video clip that plays on repeat.Perfect for use in online articles. Cartoons are a good example of GIF.
